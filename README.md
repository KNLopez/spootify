# Spotify Challenge 🎧

&nbsp;

# Goals/Outcomes ✨

-   Testing skills in consuming APIs and handling responses

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ✅

-   Have a Spotify client ID & secret and add them to `config.js`
    -   Note. **Don't add this config to version control. This should usually come from your build server.**

&nbsp;

# Requirements 📖

-   Fetch and display _Released This Week_ songs
    -   Use the API path `new-releases`
-   Fetch and display _Featured Playlists_
    -   Use the API path `featured-playlists`
-   Fetch and display _Browse_ genres
    -   Use the API path `categories`
-   Loading state/UI _(optional)_

&nbsp;

# Notes 💡

-   Use the Spotify API documentation as reference
-   Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
-   Where do you make the API requests?
-   How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done 🏁

-   UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)
